9.4 Class pooling.PooledMySQLConnection

9.4.1 Constructor pooling.PooledMySQLConnection
9.4.2 Method PooledMySQLConnection.close()
9.4.3 Method PooledMySQLConnection.config()
9.4.4 Property PooledMySQLConnection.pool_name

This class is used by MySQLConnectionPool to return a pooled connection instance. It is also the class used for connections obtained with calls to the connect() method that name a connection pool (see Section 8.1, “Connector/Python Connection Pooling”).

PooledMySQLConnection pooled connection objects are similar to MySQLConnection unpooled connection objects, with these differences:

	* To release a pooled connection obtained from a connection pool, invoke its close() method, just as for any unpooled connection. However, for a pooled connection, close() does not actually close the connection but returns it to the pool and makes it available for subsequent connection requests.

	* A pooled connection cannot be reconfigured using its config() method. Connection changes must be done through the pool object itself, as described shortly.

	* A pooled connection has a pool_name property that returns the pool name.

9.4.1 Constructor pooling.PooledMySQLConnection

Syntax:

PooledMySQLConnection(cnxpool, cnx)

This constructor takes connection pool and connection arguments and returns a pooled connection. It is used by the MySQLConnectionPool class.

Arguments:

	* cnxpool: A MySQLConnectionPool instance.

	* cnx: A MySQLConnection instance.

Example:

pcnx = mysql.connector.pooling.PooledMySQLConnection(cnxpool, cnx)

9.4.2 Method PooledMySQLConnection.close()

Syntax:

cnx.close()

Returns a pooled connection to its connection pool.

For a pooled connection, close() does not actually close it but returns it to the pool and makes it available for subsequent connection requests.

If the pool configuration parameters are changed, a returned connection is closed and reopened with the new configuration before being returned from the pool again in response to a connection request.

9.4.3 Method PooledMySQLConnection.config()

For pooled connections, the config() method raises a PoolError exception. Configuration for pooled connections should be done using the pool object.

9.4.4 Property PooledMySQLConnection.pool_name

Syntax:

cnx.pool_name
This property returns the name of the connection pool to which the connection belongs.

Example:

cnx = cnxpool.get_connection()
name = cnx.pool_name
