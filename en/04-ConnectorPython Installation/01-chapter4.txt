4.1 Installing Connector/Python from a Binary Distribution

Installers in native package formats are available for Unix and Unix-like systems, and for Windows.

You may need root or administrator privileges to perform the installation operation.

Installing Connector/Python on Microsoft Windows

	Note

		Connector/Python requires python.exe to be in the system's PATH. While installing the Python distribution on your system, either enable Add python.exe to Path or manually add it yourself. The Connector/Python MSI will fail to install if it cannot locate python.exe.

		Download and install Python for Windows from http://python.org/download/.

Windows users can use the Windows MSI Installer (.msi file). To use the MSI Installer, launch it and follow the prompts in the screens it presents to install Connector/Python in the location of your choosing.

This MSI is downloadable at http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/. Choose the Connector/Python version appropriate for the Python version that is installed on your system.

Subsequent executions of the Connector/Python MSI permit you to either repair or remove the existing Connector/Python installation.
