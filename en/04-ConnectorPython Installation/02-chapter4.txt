4.2 Installing Connector/Python Source Distribution on Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X

On Unix-like systems such as Linux distributions, Solaris, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD, you can download Connector/Python as a tar archive from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/.

To install Connector/Python from the .tar.gz file, download the latest version and follow these steps:

shell> gunzip mysql-connector-python-1.0.10.tar.gz
shell> tar xf mysql-connector-python-1.0.10.tar
shell> cd mysql-connector-python-1.0.10
shell> sudo python setup.py install

On Unix-like systems, Connector/Python is installed in the default location /prefix/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/, where prefix is the location where Python was installed and X.Y is the Python version. See How installation works in the Python manual.

If you are not sure where Connector/Python was installed, do the following to determine the location:

shell> python
>>> from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib

>>> print get_python_lib()            # Python v2.x
/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages

>>> print(get_python_lib())           # Python v3.x

/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.1/lib/python3.1/site-packages

	Note

		The preceding example shows the default installation location on Mac OS X 10.7.
