4.3 Installing Connector/Python Source Distribution on Microsoft Windows

On Microsoft Windows systems, you can download Connector/Python as a Zip archive from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/.

Make sure that the Python executable is available in the Windows %PATH% setting. For more information about installation and configuration of Python on Windows, see the section Using Python on Windows in the Python documentation.

To install Connector/Python from the .zip file, download the latest version and follow these steps:

	1.To use a Zip archive, unpack it in the intended installation directory (for example, C:\mysql-connector\) using WinZip or another tool that can read .zip files.

	2.Start a console window (or a DOS window) and change location to the folder where you unpacked the Connector/Python Zip archive:

	  shell> cd C:\mysql-connector\

	3.Inside the Connector/Python folder, perform the installation using this command:

	  shell> python setup.py install

On Windows, Connector/Python is installed in the default location C:\PythonX.Y\Lib\site-packages\ where X.Y is the Python version you used to install the connector.

If you are not sure where Connector/Python was installed, do the following to determine the location:

shell> python
>>> from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib
>>> print get_python_lib()            # Python v2.x
>>> print(get_python_lib())           # Python v3.x
